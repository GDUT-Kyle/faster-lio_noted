## FasterLIO

This is the code repository of FasterLIO by Chunge Bai, Tao Xiang, Yajie Chen, Haoqian Wang, Fang Zhang and Xiang Gao.

Faster-LIO is a light-weight Lidar-inertial odometry for lidar pose tracking and point cloud mapping. It is developed on
the base of [FastLIO2](https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST_LIO) and provides about 1.5-2x speed increase. It achieves
almost 1k-2k hz for solid-state lidars and over 100 hz for a typical 32 lines spinning lidar. Please refer to [our paper](./doc/faster-lio.pdf)
for more details.

Below is the FPS tested with avia and velodyne 32 spinning lidar from FastLIO2 and [NCLT](http://robots.engin.umich.edu/nclt/), where "AMD" is tested with  AMD R7 5800X and "Intel" tested with Intel Xeon Gold 5218.

# Quick Start

## Dependency

FasterLIO is tested in Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04. Please install the following libraries before compilation.

1. ROS (melodic or noetic)
2. glog: ```sudo apt-get install libgoogle-glog-dev```
3. eigen: ```sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev```
4. pcl: ```sudo apt-get install libpcl-dev```
5. yaml-cpp: ```sudo apt-get install libyaml-cpp-dev```

## Compile

FasterLIO can be compiled by plain cmake or catkin_make. In Ubuntu 20.04, the compile step is relatively simple.

1. Plain cmake 

Use the following commands to build FasterLIO:

```bin/bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j4
```

Note: iVox type should be specified by cmake at compile time. By default we will use linear iVox.
Use ```cmake .. -DWITH_IVOX_NODE_TYPE_PHC=ON``` to build the FasterLIO with PHC iVox.

2. catkin_make

Clone this repository to your catkin workspace, e.g., ~/catkin_ws/src, then use catkin_make instead of the above cmake
commands. You can also specify the iVox type in catkin_make parameters.

After the compilation, you will get the a libfaster_lio.so and two executable files. If you choose plain cmake build,
they will be located in ./build/devel/lib/faster_lio. If you use catkin_make, you could run them with rosrun and
roslaunch.

3. Compile in Ubuntu 18.04 or earlier

Since FasterLIO use cpp 17 as its standard (which requires a higher version of g++), you should upgrade the compiler and
use the earlier tbb library provided in the thirdparty of this repo. Please follow the steps here:

- Upgrade the g++ compiler to 9.0 or higher by:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc-9
sudo apt install g++-9
cd /usr/bin
sudo rm gcc g++
sudo ln -s gcc-9 gcc
sudo ln -s g++-9 g++
```

- unzip the tbb library in the thirdparty:

```bash
cd thirdparty
tar -xvf tbb2018_20170726oss_lin.tgz
```

- specify the tbb directory in the cmake stage:

```bash
cmake .. -DCUSTOM_TBB_DIR=`pwd`/../thirdparty/tbb2018_20170726oss
```

```
catkin build faster_lio -DCUSTOM_TBB_DIR=~/ros/livox_ws/src/faster-lio/thirdparty/tbb2018_20170726oss
```

Then just build FasterLIO with make.

## Prepare the datasets

Download the avia/nclt bags in your computer:

- [avia bags](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YL5MQVYgAM8oAWUm7e3OGXZBPKkanmY1?usp=sharing)
- [nclt bags](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VBK5idI1oyW0GC_I_Hxh63aqam3nocNK)

## Run FasterLIO

FasterLIO can be called like a plain binary program. It can run in offline mode or online mode like any ros program.

- Offline mode

Call run_mapping_offline with parameters to specify the bag file and the config file like:

```bash
./build/devel/lib/faster_lio/run_mapping_offline --bag_file your_avia_bag_file --config_file ./config/avia.yaml
```

for avia. For NCLT, just run:

```bash
./build/devel/lib/faster_lio/run_mapping_offline --bag_file your_nclt_bag_file --config_file ./config/velodyne.yaml
```

Please replace "your avia bag file" with the path in your computer. FasterLIO will print the FPS and time usage when it
quits:

```

Point clouds will be saved to PCD/scans.pcd by default. 

- Online mode 

Online mode could be launched through rosrun/roslaunch/directly call. We use roslaunch as an example:

1. Launch faster-lio: ```roslaunch faster_lio mapping_avia.launch``` This will give you a rviz window.
2. Play the bags using ```rosbag play your bag file``` to see the online outputs.

# Known Issues

- iVox is somehow sensitive to the voxel size. Please enlarge the voxel size if FasterLIO is not stable in your
  application.
- set -march=native in cmake may cause a core dump in the PCL point cloud deconstruction step (Ubuntu 20.04, gcc 11, AMD
  5800X)(Ubuntu 18.04, gcc 9, i7-10750H), see
